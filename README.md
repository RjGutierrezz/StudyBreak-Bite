## Welcome to my app 👋

This app is a mobile food discovery and delivery concept designed to support university students by making campus food access faster and more efficient. It helps students stay focused on their studies by enabling food delivery to specific campus locations, reducing interruptions and unnecessary travel. The app also offers online ordering for pickup, allowing students to skip long lines and save valuable time during busy academic schedules.
